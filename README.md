scala-linkshortener
===================

Scraped together the pieces from this post "A URL shortener service in 45 lines of Scala"
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8207054 to create a POM file thats somewhat useable.

Needs Redis installed somewhere since it points at it.

All artifacts are on mvnrepository.com in case your Nexus needs to proxy.
